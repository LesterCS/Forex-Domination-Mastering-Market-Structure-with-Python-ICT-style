# Forex Domination: Mastering Market Structure with Python, ICT Style

Discover how Python can elevate your trading skills and help you identify market trends, support and resistance levels, and price patterns like a boss.

## Identifying Market Trends

- Use Moving Averages (MAs) to identify market trends (uptrends, downtrends, and sideways trends).
- Calculate and plot the 10-day and 20-day MAs to determine the prevailing market trend.

## Support and Resistance Levels

- Use the `peakutils` library to identify local maxima and minima in price data.
- Adjust the threshold and minimum distance between levels to visualize crucial price levels on a chart.

## Price Patterns

- Use the `TA-Lib` library to identify a wide range of candlestick patterns (e.g., Two Crows, Three Black Crows, and Doji).
- Analyze and visualize these patterns to gain valuable insights into potential market movements and make more informed trading decisions.
